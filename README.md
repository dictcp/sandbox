Those are random stuff which is made by me. Some are them are library I made for project, some of them are just simple codes to verify some idea / for hands on in a new programming language. Unless stated otherwise or limited by original license, all of them are under the lincense of AGPL (and extension of GPL which somehow aims at web service)
